# Contributing to github.py

The following is a set of guidelines, not rules, for contributing to github.py.


## Issue Guidelines

<!-- A good example issue can be found [here](...). -->

- Do not open duplicate issues.
- Provide enough information for the issue to be workable.


### Bug Report

- A concise **description** of the bug report. What exactly is wrong and why?
- The **actual behaviour**. What really happened here? If you have a traceback, this is where you'd put it.
- The **expected behavior**. What did you expect to happen here? What is different?
- Easy-to-follow **reproduction steps**. Why did this happen?
- Any **additional context**. Do you have anything to add to this?
- The **checklist**. All of the boxes should be checked before you open the issue.
- Your **system information**. I may need to know your Python version and/or system information to reproduce this issue.


### Feature Request

- A concise **description**. What made you want to open this issue?
- The **current solution**. Is there an alternative?
- The **ideal solution**. This part separates an issue from a pull request, you write this in English, not Python.
- Any **additional context**. Do you have anything to add to this?
- The **checklist**. All of the boxes should be checked before you open the issue.


## Pull Request Guidelines

<!-- A good example pull request can be found [here](...). -->

- Do not open duplicate pull requests.
- Try to focus on a single aspect -- If another pull request is necessary, create one.
- Try to follow general python guidelines; such as [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- Please remember to test your PR before you open it.

- A concise **description**. What does this PR do?
- The **checklist**. One - and only one - of the two top-level boxes should be checked.


### Commit Guidelines

- Use the imperative mood. (`implement ...` not `implemented ...`)
- Reference issues and pull requests outside of the first line.
